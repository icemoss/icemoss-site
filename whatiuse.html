          The following list of software is by no means exhaustive, but what
          includes much of what I generally find useful.
        </p>
        <h1 class="medium-heading">Desktop and Phone OS</h1>
        <p class="large-text">
          <em>Desktop OS:</em>
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org/"
            >Fedora Linux</a
          ><br />
          Fedora is a nice Linux distribution with up-to-date packages with the
          stability and support of an LTS distribution. I choose to use Linux as
          an operating system as it has very good compatibility with a variety
          of programming tools, and with Steam's Proton compatibility layer it
          can run 90% of Steam games too.
          <br /><br /><em>Desktop Environment:</em>
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a
          ><br />
          KDE looks nice and is easily customisable. I prefer to use it with the
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://catppuccin.com/"
            >Catppuccin</a
          >
          theme as the color scheme looks great. The default Dolphin file
          manager also manages to do the job very well. KDE also comes
          pre-installed with
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://kdeconnect.kde.org/"
            >KDE Connect</a
          >
          which allows seamlessly linking an Android phone to my computer.
          <br /><br /><em>Phone OS:</em>
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.android.com/"
            >Android</a
          ><br />
          Android is the only option for a phone with enough customisation and
          proper support for sideloading apps. Third-party Android roms don't
          have support for certain apps, so stock is the only option for me.
          <br /><br /><em>Phone Launcher:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://niagaralauncher.app/"
            >Niagara Launcher</a
          ><br />
          Niagara Launcher keeps my phone lightweight and simple to use. All
          apps are sorted into an alphabetical list, with several pinned apps at
          the top. Instead of scrolling through the apps, you are instantly
          transported to the apps starting with a certain letter when tapping
          the side of the screen. It initially took some getting used to, but
          now it is second nature, and much faster than a stock Android
          launcher! Additionally, I theme app icons using
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.iconpackstudio.com/"
            >Icon Pack Studio</a
          >
          to give all app icons a consistent and clean theme.
        </p>
        <h1 class="medium-heading">Browser</h1>
        <p class="large-text">
          <em>Desktop Browser:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/"
            >Firefox</a
          ><br />
          Firefox is an amazing browser with compatibility for all sites, not
          forced to be based on Chromium, and has a very wide array of useful
          extensions. Not to mention it is incredibly customisable with the
          advanced "about:config" page exposing all settings used by the
          browser.
          <br /><br /><em>Mobile Browser:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/browsers/mobile/android"
            >Firefox for Android</a
          ><br />
          Firefox for Android syncs browser history with desktop Firefox, and
          has very good support for browser extensions. It is the only
          mainstream mobile browser with support for uBlock Origin and can move
          the searchbar to the bottom of the screen (which is a much more
          sensible place for it in my opinion).
          <br /><br /><em>Ad Blocker:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock"
            >uBlock Origin</a
          ><br />
          uBlock Origin is the uncontested best adblocker. It is very performant
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox"
          >
            (especially on Firefox)</a
          >
          and works great out-of-the-box. In contrast to some other ad-blockers,
          it is very customisable and has a myriad of alternative filter lists
          that can be enabled. Some examples include: blocking cookie notices
          without accepting them, removing unneccesary tracking content from
          urls, and warning about known malware sites. Furthermore, it adds the
          ability to right click on a page to selectively block unwanted html
          elements such as "Upgrade to Premium" nags on websites. There also
          exists
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home"
          >
            uBlock Origin Lite</a
          >
          though it is not nowhere near as powerful or customisable as uBlock
          Origin. However, it is based on MV3 so on some modern Chromium
          browsers it is the only option.
          <br /><br /><em>Password Manager:</em>
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com"
            >Bitwarden</a
          ><br />
          Bitwarden is a cross-platform free password manager that is very
          convenient to use. It's autofill functionality often works better than
          the default for the browser. On Android, it also autofills inside
          other apps, including those not supporting the Android Autofill
          Framework. It does offer a paid tier, but the free tier has far more
          features than many paid password managers, and it offers unlimited
          synchronised devices.
        </p>
        <h1 class="medium-heading">Development Tools</h1>
        <p class="large-text">
          <em>Text Editor:</em>
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://neovim.io/"
            >Neovim</a
          ><br />
          Neovim is a versatile text editor which is based off of Vim and uses
          Vim keybinds. These allow it to be much more efficient for editing
          code specifically than any other text editor. With just a few key
          presses, an entire paragraph could be cut, or the cursor could jump
          between matching pairs of quotation marks. The possibilities are
          endless, there are always new ways to become radically more
          productive! I personally use a pre-built configuration called
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://astronvim.com/"
            >AstroNvim</a
          >
          as it comes with plenty of useful plugins pre-installed, though I do
          make a few adjustments to suit my workflow. I use the frontend
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://neovide.dev/"
            >Neovide</a
          >
          as it makes it look nicer instead of running inside of a terminal, and
          it adds slight animation to the cursor so it is easier to track when
          navigating a file. I have customised it so that it uses the
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://catppuccin.com/"
            >Catppuccin</a
          >
          theme and the

            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/"

          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/"
            >GitHub</a
          ><br />
          GitHub is a staple in software development for its incredibly powerful
          free plan and a huge variety of additional features. Even when used
          simply, it easily allows for your code repositories to be synced
          across devices and makes collaboration between people a breeze.
          <br /><br /><em>Git Management:</em>
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://desktop.github.com/"
            >GitHub Desktop</a
          ><br />
          GitHub Desktop is a simple GUI client for managing your remote
          repositories on GitHub. However, I am starting to use the
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit"
            >Lazygit plugin</a
          >
          inside Neovim to manage my commits so they are all centralised in one
          place rather than needing to juggle several different windows. The
          GitHub Desktop client does not have an official Linux build, but I use
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit"
            >Shiftkey's build</a
          >
          which supports Linux.
          <br /><br /><em>Web Hosting:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://pages.cloudflare.com"
            >Cloudflare Pages</a
          ><br />
          Cloudflare Pages is a free service by Cloudflare allowing you to
          deploy static sites automatically whenever you push to a GitHub
          repository. With 500 builds per month and unlimited bandwidth, it is
          easy to see how it is a great choice for static sites. However, its
          incapability to host dynamic sites may make me end up looking
          elsewhere.
        </p>
        <h1 class="medium-heading">Email</h1>
        <p class="large-text">
          <em>Email Provider:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.infomaniak.com/en/free-email"
            >Infomaniak</a
          ><br />
          Infomaniak is a great service for hosting your email, and in a free
          plan offers 20GB of email storage and 15GB of general cloud storage.
          What makes it stand out above other providers is they do not sell your
          personal data, can be connected to any 3rd party email client as it
          supports IMAP, and has the short and snappy @ik.me address.
          <br /><br /><em>Desktop Email Client:</em>
          <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.thunderbird.net"
            >Thunderbird</a
          ><br />
          Thunderbird is a cross-platform email client that makes it easy to
          manage all of my different email addresses. I can log into all of them
          and favourite any folders I keep returning to. It supports client-side
          rules and uses tabs to allow switching between several emails at once.
          It's free, open source, and private. In my opinion, it is close to the
          perfect email client that I could ever want.
          <br /><br /><em>Android Email Client:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail"
            >FairEmail</a
          ><br />
          FairEmail is lightweight, minimalist, and able to connect with all of
          my email addresses. It supports push notifications and automatic setup
          with all major email providers. Although there is a one-off purchase
          for some advanced features, it is purely optional and are not
          required. It is open source, so you can contribute code to it or
          manage a private fork if you desire.
        </p>
        <h1 class="medium-heading">Android Apps</h1>
        <p class="large-text">
          <em>Discord Client:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord"
            >Aliucord</a
          ><br />
          Aliucord is a lightweight Discord client based off of the official app
          before it was redesigned to use the relatively inefficient Electron
          framework. As a result, Aliucord has far better performance and
          battery life than the official app. It supports a myriad of plugins
          such as FakeNitro and AnonymiseFileNames which are very useful. The
          installation is simple. As a result of being based off of an older
          version of the Discord app, it is missing some of the latest features
          such as super reactions and polls. However, I do not find myself
          needing to use them often, and the official app is installed at the
          same time in case I require them.
          <br /><br /><em>Youtube Client:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager"
            >Youtube Revanced</a
          ><br />
          Youtube Revanced is a modification of the official YouTube app to add
          features such as ad-blocking, SponsorBlock, Return Youtube Dislike,
          and so much more. It is installed through the Revanced Manager, which
          also has modifications for other apps. It is highly customisable which
          tweaks you wish to use, but I recommend enabling all of the default
          ones to minimise risk of breakage.
          <br /><br /><em>Youtube Downloader:</em>
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/JunkFood02/Seal"
            >Seal</a
          ><br />
          Seal is a simple frontend for the
          <a
            class="outgoing"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp"
            >yt-dlp</a
          >
          downloader. The interface is simple and intuitive, with seamless
          integration with Youtube Revanced after adding the package name to the
          settings. It supports downloading entire videos or just the audio
          (which is very useful for songs). Combined with a music player, it
          makes a great way to listen to music offline, especially the more
          niche music only available on YouTube. <br /><br /><em
            >Music Player:</em

            >Musicolet</a
          ><br />
          Musicolet is a great app for managing and playing downloaded audio
          files. With widgets, album art, queue management, lyrics, and so much
          more, it really is an amazing music player. Although it is not open
          source, it is free, has no ads, and does not have the internet
          permission so it is truly offline. There is an offered upgrade to a
          premium version for a one-time-fee of £11, which adds Chromecast
          support and even more granular sorting capabilities, but in my opinion
          is mostly unnecessary.
