      <p class="large-text">The following list of software is by no means exhaustive, but what includes much of what I
        generally find useful.
      </p>
      <h1 class="medium-heading">Desktop and Phone OS</h1>
      <p class="large-text">
        <em>Desktop OS:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Linux</a><br>
        Fedora is a nice Linux distribution with up-to-date packages with the stability
        and support of an LTS distribution. I choose to use Linux as an operating system
        as it has very good compatibility with a variety of programming tools, and with
        Steam's Proton compatibility layer it can run 90% of Steam games too.
        <br><br><em>Desktop Environment:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a><br>
        KDE looks nice and is easily customisable. I prefer to use it with the
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin</a>
        theme as the color scheme looks great. The default Dolphin file manager also
        manages to do the job very well. KDE also comes pre-installed with
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://kdeconnect.kde.org/">KDE Connect</a>
        which allows seamlessly linking an Android phone to my computer.
        <br><br><em>Phone OS:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a><br>
        Android is the only option for a phone with enough customisation and proper support
        for sideloading apps. Third-party Android roms don't have support for certain apps,
        so stock is the only option for me.
        <br><br><em>Phone Launcher:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://niagaralauncher.app/">Niagara Launcher</a><br>
        Niagara Launcher keeps my phone lightweight and simple to use. All apps are sorted
        into an alphabetical list, with several pinned apps at the top. Instead of scrolling
        through the apps, you are instantly transported to the apps starting with a certain
        letter when tapping the side of the screen. It initially took some getting used to, but
        now it is second nature, and much faster than a stock Android launcher! Additionally, I
        theme app icons using
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://www.iconpackstudio.com/">Icon Pack Studio</a>
        to give all app icons a consistent and clean theme.
      </p>
      <h1 class="medium-heading">Browser</h1>
      <p class="large-text">
        <em>Desktop Browser:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a><br>
        Firefox is an amazing browser with compatibility for all sites, not forced to be based on
        Chromium, and has a very wide array of useful extensions. Not to mention it is incredibly
        customisable with the advanced "about:config" page exposing all settings used by the browser.
        <br><br><em>Mobile Browser:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/browsers/mobile/android">Firefox for
          Android</a><br>
        Firefox for Android syncs browser history with desktop Firefox, and has very good support for
        browser extensions. It is the only mainstream mobile browser with support for Ublock Origin and
        can move the searchbar to the bottom of the screen (which is a much more sensible place for it in
        my opinion).
        <br><br><em>Ad Blocker:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">Ublock
          Origin</a><br>
        Ublock Origin is the uncontested best adblocker. It is very performant
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target"
          href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox">
          (especially on Firefox)</a>
        and works great out-of-the-box. In contrast to some other ad-blockers, it is very customisable
        and has a myriad of alternative filter lists that can be enabled. Some examples include: blocking
        cookie notices without accepting them, removing unneccesary tracking content from urls, and warning
        about known malware sites. Furthermore, it adds the ability to right click on a page to selectively
        block unwanted html elements such as "Upgrade to Premium" nags on websites. There also exists
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home">
          Ublock Origin Lite</a>
        though it is not nowhere near as powerful or customisable as Ublock Origin. However, it is based on
        MV3 so on some modern Chromium browsers it is the only option.
        <br><br><em>Password Manager:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a><br>
        Bitwarden is a cross-platform free password manager that is very convenient to use.
        It's autofill functionality often works better than the default for the browser. On
        Android, it also autofills inside other apps, including those not supporting the Android
        Autofill Framework. It does offer a paid tier, but the free tier has far more features than
        many paid password managers, and it offers unlimited synchronised devices.
