      <h1 class="medium-heading">Operating System + Utilities</h1>
      <p class="large-text">
        <em>Operating System:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Linux</a><br>
        Fedora is a nice Linux distribution with up-to-date packages with the stability
        and support of an LTS distribution. I choose to use Linux as an operating system
        as it has very good compatibility with a variety of programming tools, and with
        Steam's Proton compatibility layer it can run 90% of Steam games too.
        <br><br><em>Desktop Environment:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a><br>
        KDE looks nice and is easily customizable. I prefer to use it with the
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin</a>
        theme as the color scheme looks great. The default Dolphin file manager also
        manages to do the job very well. KDE also comes pre-installed with
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://kdeconnect.kde.org/">KDE Connect</a>
        which allows seamlessly linking an Android phone to my computer.
        <br><br><em>Phone OS:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_target" href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a><br>
        Android is the only option for a phone with enough customisation and proper support
        for sideloading apps. Third-party Android roms don't have support for certain apps,
        so stock is the only option for me.
