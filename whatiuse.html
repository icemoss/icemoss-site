      <p class="large-text">The following list of software is by no means exhaustive, but what includes much of what I
        generally find useful.
      </p>
      <h1 class="medium-heading">Desktop and Phone OS</h1>
      <p class="large-text">
        <em>Desktop OS:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Linux</a><br>
        Fedora is a nice Linux distribution with up-to-date packages with the stability
        and support of an LTS distribution. I choose to use Linux as an operating system
        as it has very good compatibility with a variety of programming tools, and with
        Steam's Proton compatibility layer it can run 90% of Steam games too.
        <br><br><em>Desktop Environment:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a><br>
        KDE looks nice and is easily customisable. I prefer to use it with the
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin</a>
        theme as the color scheme looks great. The default Dolphin file manager also
        manages to do the job very well. KDE also comes pre-installed with
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://kdeconnect.kde.org/">KDE Connect</a>
        which allows seamlessly linking an Android phone to my computer.
        <br><br><em>Phone OS:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a><br>
        Android is the only option for a phone with enough customisation and proper support
        for sideloading apps. Third-party Android roms don't have support for certain apps,
        so stock is the only option for me.
        <br><br><em>Phone Launcher:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://niagaralauncher.app/">Niagara Launcher</a><br>
        Niagara Launcher keeps my phone lightweight and simple to use. All apps are sorted
        into an alphabetical list, with several pinned apps at the top. Instead of scrolling
        through the apps, you are instantly transported to the apps starting with a certain
        letter when tapping the side of the screen. It initially took some getting used to, but
        now it is second nature, and much faster than a stock Android launcher! Additionally, I
        theme app icons using
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.iconpackstudio.com/">Icon Pack Studio</a>
        to give all app icons a consistent and clean theme.
      </p>
      <h1 class="medium-heading">Browser</h1>
      <p class="large-text">
        <em>Desktop Browser:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a><br>
        Firefox is an amazing browser with compatibility for all sites, not forced to be based on
        Chromium, and has a very wide array of useful extensions. Not to mention it is incredibly
        customisable with the advanced "about:config" page exposing all settings used by the browser.
        <br><br><em>Mobile Browser:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/browsers/mobile/android">Firefox for
          Android</a><br>
        Firefox for Android syncs browser history with desktop Firefox, and has very good support for
        browser extensions. It is the only mainstream mobile browser with support for uBlock Origin and
        can move the searchbar to the bottom of the screen (which is a much more sensible place for it in
        my opinion).
        <br><br><em>Ad Blocker:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock
          Origin</a><br>
        uBlock Origin is the uncontested best adblocker. It is very performant
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox">
          (especially on Firefox)</a>
        and works great out-of-the-box. In contrast to some other ad-blockers, it is very customisable
        and has a myriad of alternative filter lists that can be enabled. Some examples include: blocking
        cookie notices without accepting them, removing unneccesary tracking content from urls, and warning
        about known malware sites. Furthermore, it adds the ability to right click on a page to selectively
        block unwanted html elements such as "Upgrade to Premium" nags on websites. There also exists
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home">
          uBlock Origin Lite</a>
        though it is not nowhere near as powerful or customisable as uBlock Origin. However, it is
        based on MV3 so on some modern Chromium browsers it is the only option.
        <br><br><em>Password Manager:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a><br>
        Bitwarden is a cross-platform free password manager that is very convenient to use.
        It's autofill functionality often works better than the default for the browser. On
        Android, it also autofills inside other apps, including those not supporting the Android
        Autofill Framework. It does offer a paid tier, but the free tier has far more features than
        many paid password managers, and it offers unlimited synchronised devices.
      </p>
      <h1 class="medium-heading">Development Tools</h1>
      <p class="large-text">
        <em>Text Editor:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a><br>
        Neovim is a versatile text editor which is based off of Vim and uses Vim keybinds. These
        allow it to be much more efficient for editing code specifically than any other text editor.
        With just a few key presses, an entire paragraph could be cut, or the cursor could jump between
        matching pairs of quotation marks. The possibilities are endless, there are always new ways to
        become radically more productive! I personally use a pre-built configuration called
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://astronvim.com/">AstroNvim</a>
        as it comes with plenty of useful plugins pre-installed, though I do make a few adjustments to
        suit my workflow. I use the frontend
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://neovide.dev/">Neovide</a>
        as it makes it look nicer instead of running inside of a terminal, and it adds slight animation
        to the cursor so it is easier to track when navigating a file. I have customised it so
        that it uses the
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://catppuccin.com/">Catppuccin</a>
        theme and the
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrainsMono Font</a>,
        downloadable as a Nerd Font with icon support from
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads">nerdfonts.com</a>.
        <br><br><em>Git Host:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a><br>
        GitHub is a staple in software development for its incredibly powerful free plan and a huge variety
        of additional features. Even when used simply, it easily allows for your code repositories to be synced
        across devices and makes collaboration between people a breeze.
        <br><br><em>Git Management:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a><br>
        GitHub Desktop is a simple GUI client for managing your remote repositories on GitHub.
        However, I am starting to use the
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit">Lazygit plugin</a>
        inside Neovim to manage my commits so they are all centralised in one place rather than needing to
        juggle several different windows. The GitHub Desktop client does not have an official Linux build, but
        I use
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit">Shiftkey's build</a>
        which supports Linux.
        <br><br><em>Web Hosting:</em>
        <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://pages.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare Pages</a><br>
        Cloudflare Pages is a free service by Cloudflare allowing you to deploy static sites automatically
        whenever you push to a GitHub repository. With 500 builds per month and unlimited bandwidth, it is
        easy to see how it is a great choice for static sites. However, its incapability to host dynamic
        sites may make me end up looking elsewhere.
      </p>
      <h1 class="medium-heading">Email</h1>
      <p class="large-text">
      <em>Email Provider:</em>
      <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.infomaniak.com/en/free-email">Infomaniak</a><br>
      Infomaniak is a great service for hosting your email, and in a free plan offers 20GB of email storage 
      and 15GB of general cloud storage. What makes it stand out above other providers is they do not sell your 
      personal data, can be connected to any 3rd party email client as it supports IMAP, and has the short and snappy 
      @ik.me address.
      <em>Desktop Email Client:</em>
      <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://www.thunderbird.net">Thunderbird</a><br>
      Thunderbird is a cross-platform email client that makes it easy to manage all of my different email addresses. 
      I can log into all of them and favourite any folders I keep returning to. It supports client-side rules and 
      uses tabs to allow switching between several emails at once. It's free, open source, and private. In my opinion, 
      it is close to the perfect email client that I could ever want.
      <em>Android Email Client:</em>
      <a class="outgoing" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail">FairEmail</a><br>
      FairEmail is lightweight, minimalist, and able to connect with all of my email addresses. It supports push notifications 
      and automatic setup with all major email providers. Although there is a one-off purchase for some advanced features, it 
      is purely optional and are not required. It is open source, so you can contribute code to it or manage a private fork if you 
      desire.
